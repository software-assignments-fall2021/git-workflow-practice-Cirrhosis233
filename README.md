This article talked about challenges in software development to companies, it also talled about how pandemic influenced sofware engineers' daily work.

The biggest challenge for companies is relate to hiring talent software engineers and capacity.

While it also lists several solutions to these challenges, I noticed one of the solution: Outsourcing to contractors that I had expeienced during my first internship. During that internship our team had faced the problem of lacking front-end software engineer to help develop our interface of web program, so our leader decided to outsourcing the front-end job to contractors. Finally we finished the project well on time thanks to our leaders decision. After all, this solution worked in my reallife experience.
